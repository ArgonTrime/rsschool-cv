## About me

Hello everyone, I'm a beginner front-end developer. Having worked in various fields of activity, I canâ€™t say that some professions were more important than others and now I settled on IT, as this is a promising area with various technologies and constant development. In front-end development, the result of my work is instantly visible, so I decided to develop in this direction. To do this, I study various books, watch videos and take courses, as well as refer to the official documentation on a particular technology or functionality. In my spare time, I like to walk in the open air and travel by car, I have almost all categories and dream of a motorcycle.
